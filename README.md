Plotline is a modern web application for **online book clubs**. It helps readers create and join clubs, assign books, set shared reading goals, track progress, and have real-time discussions around what they’re reading.

At a high level, Plotline provides:
- **Book clubs and membership**: Users can start clubs, invite friends, and manage roles (host, moderator, members).
- **Shared reading goals**: Club hosts assign books, define page ranges and deadlines, and everyone’s progress is tracked against the same goal.
- **Discussion threads and replies**: Structured conversations for each club, with posts, replies, and voting to surface the most helpful comments.
- **Live chat**: Real-time messaging inside each club for casual conversation while reading together.
- **User profiles and bookshelf**: Each user has a profile and a personal bookshelf that summarizes current reads, past reads, and club activity.

Plotline is built as a full-stack JavaScript app with a React frontend and a Node/Express backend, using a relational database for persistent storage and Socket.IO for live updates. It’s designed to feel like a cozy digital reading room where people can read, talk, and stay motivated together.
